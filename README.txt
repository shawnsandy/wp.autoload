PHP Autoload Manager was created to allow me to easily extend the power of WordPress by using PHP’s autoload function to quickly add and use external PHP classes / libraries in my WordPress projects without having to add tons of file include lines!

== Description ==

It’s a… Beta! It may not have taken nine months but I’m just as happy that it’s here; WP.Autoload V2.0 beta is now available on Github. Version 2.0 main focus was :

Improve auto loading functionality, speed and efficiency.
Offer multiple options for autoloading classes.
Encourage a WordPress (PHP 5.2) compliant naming standards for classes based on the PSR-0 when / wherever possible.
Develop and create apps / tools that demonstrate and encourage developers to use and embrace object oriented php in WordPress.
The WP.Autoload class was added to help improve and provide additional options for effectively loading classes into projects. It uses the Zend Framework naming conventions for PHP classes to encourage the use PSR-0 compliant standards for classes.

I have also added several Modules and Components : Query, CustomType, Pointers, AdminBar and several others. These provide working examples of some of the benefits of using object oriented programming in WordPress projects.

All the major bases have been covered as regards to the goals of V2.0, the beta has been switched to a new Github repository https://github.com/shawnsandy/wp.autoload and the website has been given a makeover for good measure.
